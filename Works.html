                    <p>
                        The pet system has 4 parts: A pet shop, an egg system, a pet 
                        inventory and a pet equip/follow. The pet shop has a GUI with 
                        all the available pets on sale categorized with its pet type. 
                        Hovering the mouse over the pet image shows its name, its buff
                        /effects, and its price. The egg system is just like a shop 
                        but the price is the same for all the pets and it will give 
                        you a random pet. The pet inventory has a GUI containing images 
                        of the pets owned by the player categorized with its pet type. 
                        Hovering your mouse over the pet image shows the pet name, and 
                        pet buffs/effects. Lastly, the pets are equippable and the pets 
                        will follow the player wherever it goes.

                    <p>
                        The dice game requires 2 players, the 2 players will need to 
                        seat at the table. One player will be in the red team and the 
                        other player will be in the blue team. Once both players hit 
                        the ready button, the dice game starts. The 2 players will take
                        turns rolling their dice. Whoever gets the highest roll wins 
                        the round. First to get 2 round wins will win the dice game and
                        get a reward.

                    <p>
                        The car shop system that was requested to me was very simple. 
                        The player steps on a part, the car shop GUI shows up. The 
                        player clicks which car to buy, and the car will spawn on the 
                        platform.
                        <br><br>
                        <i>Disclaimer: I did NOT script the cars. They were free models 
                        provided by the client.</i>
                    </p>

                    <h3> Intel System </h3>

                    <div class = "vid">
                        <iframe 
                            src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sU96QEWxoPE" title="Intel System">

                    <p>
                        The intel system also requires at least 2 players. When a 
                        player clicks the "Get Intel Target" GUI button, the game 
                        will give a camera tool to that player. The game will also 
                        choose a random player as an <i>Intel Target</i>. The player 
                        then needs to click the targeted player while holding the 
                        camera withing 50 studs away.

                    <h3> Delivery System </h3>

                    <p>
                        In the delivery system, when the player presses the <i>Delivery </i>
                        GUI button, a package will spawn at a random location. The 
                        player then needs to retrieve the package at the location by 
                        pressing <b>F</b> while within 5 studs away from the package. 
                        Then the game will choose a random delivery location where 
                        player needs to bring the package. The player gets a reward 
                        for delivering the package.

                    <p>
                        The arrest system works similar to the delivery system. 
                        The player presses <b>F</b> to arrest the NPC. Then the 
                        player needs to bring the retricted NPC to a specific 
                        location to get a reward.

                    <p>
                        In this game system, the game will choose a random player 
                        every 10 minutes to be marked with a $10,000 bounty. The 
                        players in the game will have 10 minutes to kill the player 
                        with the bounty. If a player gets the bounty, that said 
                        player will receive the bounty reward, but if the target 
                        survives for 10 minutes without getting killed, no one 
                        gets the bounty.
